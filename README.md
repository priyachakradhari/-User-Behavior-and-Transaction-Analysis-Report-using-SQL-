# User-Behavior-and-Transaction-Analysis-Report-using-SQL-

## Introduction :
This analysis explores user engagement and transaction behaviors on a platform, using SQL to derive insights from user, transaction, and session data. Key focuses include new user transaction rates, daily active users (DAU), average deposit amounts by country, session duration by device type, and identifying top spenders. These insights aim to inform strategic decisions for enhancing user experience and targeted engagement.

## Dataset Description : 
The analysis is based on three primary tables:

1. Users - User details including ID, name, registration date, and country.
2. Transactions - Individual transactions including ID, user ID, amount, date, and type.
3. Sessions - User sessions including session ID, user ID, start and end times, and device type.

## Objectives :
The main goals are:

- Evaluate new user engagement within the first 7 days.
- Analyze deposit behaviors by country.
- Track daily active users over the last 30 days.
- Identify top users by session duration across devices.
- Determine transaction frequency per user.
- Highlight top-spending users by country.

## Methodology :
SQL queries were used to extract relevant data:

- New user transaction rates within the first 7 days.
- Average deposit amount by country for the last 3 months.
- Daily active user counts over 30 days.
- Top users by session duration on mobile and desktop.
- Transaction frequency over 6 months.
- Top spending users by country based on total deposits.

## Analysis and Insights :
- New User Engagement: Percentage of new users making transactions within their first week.
- Deposit Behavior: Average deposit amounts by country, highlighting regional patterns.
- Daily Active Users: DAU analysis to observe platform activity trends.
- Session Duration: Top users by session length on mobile and desktop.
- Transaction Frequency: Average transactions per user, reflecting engagement.
- Top Spending Users: Identification of high-value users by country.

## Conclusion :
The report uncovers key insights into user engagement, financial behaviors, and device-based preferences. These findings can help optimize user onboarding, enhance engagement, and support targeted marketing strategies.

## Future Scope :
- Enhanced Segmentation - Further user breakdowns by demographics or behaviors.
- Predictive Analytics - Applying ML to predict user retention and churn.
- Personalized Experiences - Customizing features based on device and regional trends.
- Real-Time Monitoring - Dashboard implementation for dynamic decision-making.
